# I2C Buffer mikroShield

This mikroBUS-compatible mikroShield protects a mainboard's power and I2C lines when connecting unpowered off-board devices. For self-powered devices, an isolated adapter board is preferred.

## Features

- PTC resettable fuse on the 5 V supply rail (200 mA hold, 400 mA trip)
- Dedicated 3.3 V linear regulator from the protected 5 V rail
- I2C buffer / repeater (5500 V HBM ESD)
- ESD protection (TVS) diodes on external SCL, SDA, and 3.3V supply lines
- Series current-limiting resistors on the SCL and SDA external signal lines
- 100 mils output connector compatible with Grove, quiic, and STEMMA adapter boards for a direct board-to-board connection.
